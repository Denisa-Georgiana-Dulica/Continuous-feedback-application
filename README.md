# Continuous feedback application
# What is the main need/problem that the product solves?
  A web application for continuous feedback is useful for improving the quality of work within a university. This way, professors always know if the material is understood by the students, and if the teaching methods are effective. Moreover, they can observe the students' status during an activity and identify moments when changes might be needed. For students, it is an opportunity to express their opinions and feelings regarding the professor's activities.

Login page: Upon login, each student and teacher have predefined accounts in the database. Each account is unique and associated with a specific role (student or teacher). Users can only use the predefined account in the database to log in to the application.

- The student can only access the student page and the teacher can only access the teacher page.
- If a student tries to log in on the teacher's page or vice versa, this will not be allowed.
- If a user does not exist in the database or the data entered does not correspond to the data in the database, he will not be able to connect and will receive an error message.
