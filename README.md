## What is the main need/problem that the product solves?
💥 A web application for continuous feedback is useful for improving the quality of work within a university. This way, professors always know if the material is understood by the students, and if the teaching methods are effective. Moreover, they can observe the students' status during an activity and identify moments when changes might be needed. For students, it is an opportunity to express their opinions and feelings regarding the professor's activities.

❗ Upon login, each student and teacher have predefined accounts in the database. Each account is unique and associated with a specific role (student or teacher). Users can only use the predefined account in the database to log in to the application.

💥 Login page include: 
- The student can only access the student page and the teacher can only access the teacher page.
- If a student tries to log in on the teacher's page or vice versa, this will not be allowed.
- If a user does not exist in the database or the data entered does not correspond to the data in the database, he will not be able to connect and will receive an error message.

💥 Student page include:

- The student enters his page and selects the teacher whose activities he wants to view.
- To provide feedback, the student must first enter the activity's access code.
- After entering the code correctly, a feedback box will appear where the student can provide more feedback for that activity.
- If the access code is incorrect or if the activity deadline has passed, the student will not be able to provide feedback.

## User feedback:
💥 Our colleagues tested the site and appreciated being able to share their opinions about each activity. This feedback is collected anonymously, which allows them to express their honest opinions about educational activities. In addition, the interface is simple and easy to use, and the user experience is very positive. Users have mentioned that it would be great to be able to add written feedback, and also anonymously to provide additional details about the activities they are involved in.
